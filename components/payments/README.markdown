#Saving a Credit Card outside of a transaction

Both credit cards and customers respond to a resource-based RESTful interface.

Credit cards are related to customers.  A credit card cannot exist without being attached to a customer.  So, to save a card, first save the customer.

*Save a card*

*Request*

    POST /payments/cards
    {"cardNumber":"4111111111111111","expirationDate":"05/2011","cardholderName":"Joe Cool","customer":{"id":"285161"}}

You can send the entire customer if needed, but only the id is necessary

*Response*

    {"cardNumber":"411111******1111","expirationDate":"05/2011","cardholderName":"Joe Cool","token":"hdgt","id":"hdgt","customer":{"id":"285161"}}

*Update a card*

*Request*

    PUT /payments/cards/{id}
    {"expirationDate":"12/2012","cardholderName":"Joe Cool","token":"9f9p","id":"9f9p","customer":{"id":"485254"}}

**You cannot update a card number for a saved credit card** so don't modify the cardNumber field in your PUT request.  If you include a number, updated or otherwise, ATHENA will ignore it.

*Response*

    {"cardNumber":"411111******1111","expirationDate":"12/2012","cardholderName":"Joe Cool","token":"9f9p","id":"9f9p","customer":{"id":"485254"}}

*Get a card*

*Request*

    GET /payments/cards/{id}

*Response*

    {"cardNumber":"411111******1111","expirationDate":"12/2012","cardholderName":"Joe Cool","token":"9f9p","id":"9f9p","customer":{"id":"485254"}}

*Delete a card*
